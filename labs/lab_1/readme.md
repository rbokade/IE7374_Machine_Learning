## Running the code:
    - Install required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - To run the code and save the results: `python main.py`
        - This will create two files
            1. results_with_given_tolerance.yaml (MLR (normal) and MLR (gradient descent) with given hyperparameters)
            2. results_with_all_tolerances.yaml (MLR (normal) and MLR (gradient descent) with all the different tolerances)

    - Train and test set are split 0.7:0.3
